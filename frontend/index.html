            You might be wondering... What is a slow loris? Glad you ask! Slow
            lorises are a species of primates that can be found in Southeast
            Asia. They are known for their large eyes, which are part of their
            adaption as nocturnal animals to be active during the night. Eight
            known species of slow lorises exist and all of which are considered
            "vulnerable" or "endangered" animals due to deforestation and
            illegal pet trade in the black market. Currently, conservation
            efforts towards slow lorises have prevailed such as education to
            learn about them and protecting their natural habitats from human
            activity.
