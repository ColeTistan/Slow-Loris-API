## About
Slow lorises are a species of primates that can be found in Southeast Asia. They are known for their large eyes, which are part of their adaption as nocturnal animals to be active during the night. Eight known species of slow lorises exist and all of which are considered "vulnerable" or "endangered" animals due to deforestation and illegal pet trade in the black market. Currently, conservation efforts towards slow lorises have prevailed such as education to learn about them and protecting their natural habitats from human activity.

## Purpose 
I want to build this API to help people learn about these amazing animals and why it is important to keep slow lorises from risking of becoming extinct due to human activity.

## Technologies Used
Python, Beautiful Soup, CSV module, Flask, Bootstrap 5
